// // Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

// // Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

// // Example:
// // n= 5, m=5: 25
// // n=-5, m=5:  0
// // Waiting for translations and Feedback! Thanks!

// solving format is strange... never mind

//turns out I had the wrong setting turned on LMAO.. so this was solved on June 17 2022

const paperwork = (n, m) => ((n > 0) && (m > 0)) ? n * m : 0;
